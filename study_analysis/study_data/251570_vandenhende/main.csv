I am familiar with both species, but if I weren't, it is obvious that Alpha is a species of gull, from which you can focus on the common traits that differentiate gull species from one another - mantle colour, leg colour, eye colour, proportions and markings of the bill. There is only one gull that is pure white, the Ivory gull, which is black-spotted (still very distinctive) when young. Beta is a tubenose, and the proportion of the bill (thick and short) generally rules out shearwaters, albatrosses, storm petrels. The only white-headed petrels are the fulmars and the snow petrel, and the grey mantle and general chunky shape of the bird point to a fulmar. Southern fulmar has a bill that is pink and blue, not grey and yellow."

In most pictures, plumage alone would get you quite far because Northern Fulmar / Ivory Gull are quite different. It would then go to structure: order Procellariiformes is a primarily seafaring one with very limited land abilities (shown in their wing and leg structure). Gulls are masters of both and have structurally evolved accordingly."
