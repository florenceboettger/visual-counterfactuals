The Beta birds seemed to have smoother patterns that were made up of larger regions of the bird's body. I think maybe the Beta birds had stubbier beaks but I'm uncertain? It seemed like having two especially distinct colors making those large patterns around a bird's eyes was of particular importance in determining that a bird was of species Beta.
